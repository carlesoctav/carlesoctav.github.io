## Understanding Workplace Culture

Workplace culture refers to the shared values and practices that shape both internal dynamics among employees and external perceptions of an organization. Each company possesses its unique core values, and there exists a distinction between formal and informal cultures. Aligning personal values with a company's culture enhances job satisfaction, fostering a more fulfilling work environment.

Work etiquette, a set of expected behaviors, serves as a means to maintain a positive company image and mutual respect among team members. While these norms may vary across cultures, adhering to a universal set of standards cultivates unity and professionalism.
